Review Comments:

1.Divided a difficult task into different sub task.
2.Strong logic in how the different tasks should be done.(withinBoard,putOnBoard,occupiedPositions) And different methods are named after these sub-tasks making the code easy to understand.
3.Recursion is used to examine the placement sequence, which made the code compact.
4.Used a global variable(BOARD_STATUS) to store the status of the board, which made the status of the game easy to understand.
5.Relevant tests are provided for tracking the correctness of the code.
6.Codes are well documented.
7.Variables' name and methods' are named properly.
