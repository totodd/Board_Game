Review Comments:

1. StepsGame.java: 324 The comment is properly used and all variable are following conventions in terms of capitalization
2. StepsGame.java: 347-357 too many for loops, can use recursion instead to increase readability
3. StepsGame.java: 344 the class and structure is well settled
4. StepsGame.java: 399 the method name can be set as nextViablePlacements to increase readability
5. StepsGame.java: 402 the global variables are not necessary and can be transferred as method output to keep the code neat

In general,
Codes are well documented;
Variables' name and methods' are named properly;
Methods work properly and are effective;
