Review Comments:

1. Enum class "Pieces" is clear and good enough to be used
2. Class "Place" contains all necessary methods (flip,rotation,get board index, get center); They are well organized and easy to be used
3. Task 2 has been completed and can work properly based on the requirement. The using of the ASCII Table is appreciated.
4. Task 3 used the array to store information of each single piece placement, which is good and easy to understand.
Overall:
All of the codes are well documented;
Variables' name and methods' name are properly and consistent throughout;
Methods work properly and are effective and efficient;
